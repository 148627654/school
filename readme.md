- [x] Financial support is substantial. It is clearly stated as "partral", based on the questions answered during registration, and a decision will be made within 14 days. "Serve" does not have "d". These two words should be in red font and given a title. We understand that many people are coming, and we appreciate everyone's efforts. Therefore, we will provide financial assistance. Those in need should provide detailed answers during registration. We will make a decision based on the answers (distance, academic background, etc.) within 14 days, and there will be an additional 14-day period for decision payment. If the payment is not made, the scholarship will be cancelled.And the format has been adjusted, with both ends aligned.
